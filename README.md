This is my first time building a PHP and MySQL project from scratch. 
I created this system to practice basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and to understand how PHP connects to a database using MySQL.

The system is a simple Client Booking Management System where you can manage clients, services, bookings, tools, and payments. 
It also has a dashboard that shows total clients, services, bookings, and total revenue.

This project is still in progress and not fully finished yet, but the main features are already working and I’m continuing to improve it as I learn more.

## Features

- Dashboard summary (clients, services, bookings, revenue)
- Client management (add, edit, list)
- Services, bookings, tools, and payments pages (in progress / depends on current files)

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- XAMPP (local development)
